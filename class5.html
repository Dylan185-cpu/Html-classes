                <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    Dogs are intelligent animals
                     with a sense of smell that is up to 40 times more sensitive than humans',
                      can see some color,
                     and are as smart as two-year-old children. They sweat through their paws,
                     can be right or left-pawed, and their unique nose prints are like fingerprints.
                     Pups are born deaf, blind, and toothless,
                     developing these senses later in life.

                   Studies show dogs provide significant health and mental well-being benefits,
                    such as increased physical activity and reduced stress,
                     but also present environmental challenges.
                     Research on the history of dog domestication
                      suggests it occurred at least twice from gray wolves,
                    and the Dog Aging Project is currently studying canine aging.
